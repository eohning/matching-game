#Diwali Matching Game
This is a simple digital matching game similar to the game you're used to that uses cards in real life. There are 8 pairs of images on the other side of each card, and it's up to you to find and match the pairs.

#Instructions
Click on two cards. They will flip over to reveal their hidden image. If the images do not match, they will flip back over to hide their image.

Remember the images you just saw.

Now click another card. If it matches an image you previously saw, go click on the back of that card to make a match. If it doesn't look like a card you've seen already, click a new card to reveal it's image also.

Once all 8 pairs are matched and visible, you've won the game.

#Scoring
**Moves**
One move is equal to two cards being clicked whether they match or not.

**Stars**
You will start with five stars. The more moves made, the number of stars will decrease. Try to make as few moves as possible and keep as many stars as you can.

**Time**
Once you've made you're first click on a card, the timer will start and run until you've matched all 8 pairs of cards. Try to get all matches in as little time as possible.

##Other Considerations
After you've won the game, a summary of your score will appear and tell you your final move count, star count, and total time elapsed.

If at any time you would like to start the game over and re-deal the deck of cards, just click the restart arrow in the top right corner.
